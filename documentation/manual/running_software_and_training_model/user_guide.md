## Overview

While our solution has been accurately developed and optimised, it is only a prototype, and not robust enough to be used in a commercial, real-world scenario.  Due to this, we propose that you obey the following while using the system:

## **1.) Remain within two metres of the camera module (ideally one metre).**

Extensive testing revealed that this is the optimal range for the system to work accurately.  Please also ensure that you remain relatively still to allow the system to detect the face, face mask, and temperature properly.

## **2.) Ensure that you are facing the camera module straight on.**

While the system has been trained to detect face mask placement and temperatures from the side, there are occasionally false positives.  Remaining straight and still will guarantee more accurate readings.

## **3.) Remove all accessories or objects which may obfuscate the face, or produce high temperature readings, for instance, coffee mugs, scarves, and glasses.**

Similar to the previous point, the system has been trained to function against these conditions, but there are occasional false positives, for example, the system may detect proper facemask placement if the individual is wearing glasses, or it may detect a fever if there is a hot coffee mug in the frame.
